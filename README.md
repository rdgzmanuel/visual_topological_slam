**Title:** *Visual Topological SLAM using Deep Learning Techniques*  
**University:** Comillas Pontifical University  
**Year:** 2025  
**Abstract:** Topological maps represent an environment as a graph, with nodes corresponding to points of interest and edges representing traversable paths. They offer efficient integration with natural language modules and are computationally lighter than metric maps, which, while more precise, demand greater processing power. This work presents a system for constructing a topological map of an indoor environment using odometry measurements and
camera images. Visual inputs are processed through a deep learning model to extract feature representations, which are then used for similarity comparisons during node extraction. Odometry data is used to refine node positions, enhancing robustness. A loop closure detection and rewiring mechanism is proposed to update loop edges when a closure is detected, improving the connectivity between affected nodes. Two different trajectories are aligned and their nodes fused to increase robustness and correct detection errors. Finally, semantic information is incorporated by first detecting the objects in each nodeâ€™s image, then listing them in a sentence and lastly obtaining the embedding of the sentence with a language model. This process enables voice-controlled navigation.
